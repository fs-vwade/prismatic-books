### Serve the Data with Express

1. Install Express and create a server with a `/books` router.
2. Create the following `/books` routes.
   - `GET /books` - returns an array of all books
   - `GET /books/:id` - returns a single book with the specified id
   - `POST /books` - adds a new book to the database
   - `PUT /books/:id` - overwrites the book with the information provided in the request body
   - `DELETE /books/:id` - deletes the book with the specified id

You now have a fully working CRUD API!
